Que-does other ML type except RL require data to process on?

cast 

crew

will data in one box be of less lines?

movies.head(1).['cast'].value

how to reduce 23 columns?

Que-can we reduce such things that do not /may not be benifit for movies recommendation?

ex-will actor be good to show other movies of that actor?
2.if one is true then will it be good to recommend movies that are true event based?

drop something

preprocessing

stirng to list conversion 

dict actor only 3 why?

python function

why crew was diff then cast then genre etc?

lemda function


why space removal is important?

why again to string conversion?

why do we need to make tag?

Que-if we want to make a movies recommndation system that show similar movies

now what can be basis that will show that two movies are similar

1st problem is that tags are in english so we need to find similar words in two movies?

Que-how to find out that?

text to vector

stop words

scikit learn

similar word reduce

slitlearn consine similarity instead of distance similarity?

7. Free Tier:
Heroku offers a free tier that is suitable for personal projects,
 prototypes, or learning purposes. The free tier has limitations
  such as automatic sleeping of apps after 30 minutes of inactivity,
   but it's great for experimenting with applications.

what does it mean by dataframe
why we are keeping dataframe only include of
movie-id|title|tags
tags=overview+cast +crew+genre+keyword
why merging data?

why in tag both may cause confusion?
so why do we need to concatenate these?

conceptual part
vectorization
out of 5000 thousand movies how would you determine that they are similar on basis of tag?

let su assume you have to movies then how will you say that they are similar?
i will say if it depends upon how many words mathces between them?

now let assume that in one tag one word ocuurs mutiple time and in another same word also occurs multiple
times 

now let us aasume that two tages with same total word are same and in another
same numbers of words plus also each word count are also same
which one will you pick?


so what to do for that above most common words?

why all tags are first concatinated?

text to vector 

type
bags of word
ifidf
wordvect

let us choose 5000 most common words
so 5000  into 5000

stops word should not be considered while vectoriseing?
are am i ?

what does it mean by stemming?
cosine distance 
dist inverversly pro to similarity
