# 🎬 Movie Recommender System (TMDb Dataset)

Welcome to the **Movie Recommender System**! This project leverages the **TMDb (The Movie Database)** dataset to recommend movies to users based on their preferences. The system uses both **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering** techniques to suggest the best movies.

## 🌟 Features

- **Movie Data:** Uses detailed movie data like title, genre, ratings, and more from the TMDb dataset.
- **Recommendation Algorithms:**  
  - Collaborative Filtering (based on user-item interactions)
  - Content-Based Filtering (based on movie features)
- **User Preferences:** Recommends movies tailored to user preferences or similar movie choices.
